### create the first difference of the logarithmized series ###
# Create an empty dataframe to store the first differences

### transform stationary data to time series ###
# Create an empty dataframe to store the transformed time series
ts_vars_stationary <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = ncol(vars_stationary), nrow = nrow(vars_stationary)-1))
# Set the column names of vars_ts
colnames(ts_vars_stationary) <- colnames(vars_stationary)

# Loop through each column in vars_stationary
for (i in 1:ncol(vars_stationary)) {
  # Convert column to a time series object
  ts_vars_stationary[, i] <- ts(vars_stationary[-1, i],start = c(1980, 11), frequency = 12)
}

# View the resulting dataframe
