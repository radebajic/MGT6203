## Project Description:
This project focuses on evaluating the performance and reliability of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in forecasting agricultural commodity prices. Agricultural commodity prices are known for their volatility and susceptibility to various economic and environmental factors. The goal of this study is to explore whether advanced machine learning techniques can effectively predict future commodity prices, and if not, how they can still provide valuable insights to commodity traders and decision-makers.

## Project Goal:
The main objective of this research is twofold. Firstly, we aim to assess the predictive capabilities of popular machine learning algorithms, such as ARIMA, LSTM, RNN, Silverkite, and others, when applied to monthly time series data of agricultural commodity prices spanning from November 1980 to February 2016. By rigorously examining data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation, we seek to determine whether these algorithms can reliably forecast future commodity prices.

Secondly, in cases where the machine learning algorithms fall short in providing accurate predictions, our goal is to identify their potential to offer directional insights. We aim to understand if these models can still offer valuable indications of the general trends and likely directions in which commodity prices may move in the future. Such directional insights can be crucial for commodity traders and businesses seeking to make informed decisions related to investments, risk management, and supply chain planning.

The findings and insights derived from this research are expected to contribute significantly to enhancing decision-making processes in the agricultural commodity sector. By better understanding how these machine learning models interact with the complex dynamics of commodity prices and external factors, stakeholders can gain valuable perspectives on how to interpret and leverage these models in practical settings. Ultimately, this study seeks to strengthen the understanding of how commodity prices relate to different exogenous variables, enabling more informed and strategic decision-making in the domain of agricultural commodities.
